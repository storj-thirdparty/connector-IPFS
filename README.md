## Overview

The IPFS Connector connects to an IPFS server, takes a backup of the specified files and uploads the backup data on Storj network.

```bash
Usage:
  connector-ipfs [command] <flags>

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  store       Command to upload data to a Storj V3 network.
  version     Prints the version of the tool

```

`store` - Connect to the specified IPFS (default: `ipfs_property.json`). Back-up of the IPFS is generated using tooling provided by IPFS and then uploaded to the Storj network.  Connect to a Storj v3 network using the access specified in the Storj configuration file (default: `storj_config.json`).

Sample configuration files are provided in the `./config` folder.
